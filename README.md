## Git commit information


Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the Git repository to your local machine. Replace repository-url with the actual URL of the repository you want to work on.

'''
    Copy code
    git clone repository-url
    cd repository-directory
'''

Step 2: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch with your name (or any meaningful name related to your task). This branch will be based on the frontend branch.

```
    git checkout -b your-name-branch frontend
    For example, if your name is "Phoenix," you can create a branch like this:
```

```
git checkout -b phoenix-branch frontend
```


Step 3: Make Changes

Make your changes, such as adding or modifying code, in this branch. Commit your changes as you normally would:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```


Step 4: Push the Branch
Push your branch to the remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.):

```
    git push origin your-name-branch
    Step 5: Create a Pull Request
```

Go to the repository on the web (e.g., GitHub) and navigate to the "Pull Requests" section. Click on the "New Pull Request" button.

For the "base" branch, select frontend.
For the "compare" branch, select your-name-branch.
Write a meaningful title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you made. Then, click the "Create Pull Request" button.

Step 6: Review and Merge

Your pull request is now created. Wait for reviewers to review your changes. Once approved, you can merge the pull request into the frontend branch.

```
    # Clone the repository
    git clone repository-url
    cd repository-directory

    # Create a new branch based on 'frontend'
    git checkout -b phoenix-branch frontend

    # Make changes, commit, and push
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implemented feature X"
    git push origin phoenix-branch

    # Create a pull request on the repository's web interface
    # Set 'base' to 'frontend' and 'compare' to 'phoenix-branch'
    # Add title and description, and create the pull request

    # Wait for reviewers to approve and merge the pull request
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
